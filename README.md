# Password Management Tools

Convert your browser-exported passwords to Bitwarden format with intelligent name detection and organization features.

When importing passwords from browser exports into Bitwarden, several fields are often missing or unclear.

This tool streamlines the conversion process, providing clean entry names, folder organization, and proper formatting for seamless import.

## Quick Start

### Install Python (Beginners)

1. **Download Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Choose the latest version for your operating system
   - **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. **Verify installation** by opening Command Prompt/Terminal and typing:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

### Install Dependencies

This project uses only built-in Python libraries - no additional installations required.

### Usage

1. **Export your passwords** from your browser as CSV file
2. **Rename the file** to `Passwords.csv` and place it in this folder
3. **Change the directory** to the folder with the file
4. **Run the converter:**
   ```
   python csv_to_bitwarden.py
   ```
5. **Follow the interactive prompts** to organize your passwords
6. **Sort your passwords**:
   ```
   python sort.py
   ```
7. **Import the resulting** `Sorted_Pswds.csv` into Bitwarden

## File Overview

### Core Tools

#### `csv_to_bitwarden.py` - Main Conversion Tool

Converts CSV password exports from Chrome/Edge and compatible browsers to Bitwarden format.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive name selection** with smart suggestions
- **Android app support** - handles mobile app passwords with clean names
- **Folder organization** - create and organize folders on-the-fly
- **Express mode** - skip optional fields for faster bulk processing
- **Fuzzy matching** - helps fix typos in folder names
- **Input validation** - ensures your CSV file is in the correct format

#### `uri_mapping.py` - URI Mapping Dictionary

Provides clean, readable names for websites and Android apps. Handles both convenience mappings for common services and translation of genuinely obscure package names.

**Examples:**

- `com.zhiliaoapp.musically` → "TikTok" (obscure package name)
- `com.netflix.mediaclient` → "Netflix" (convenience mapping)
- `com.facebook.katana` → "Facebook" (obscure package name)

Easily extensible - add new mappings as needed.

#### `sort.py` - Password Organizer

Sorts converted passwords by multiple criteria with hierarchical organization.

**Features:**

- **Multi-level sorting** - sort by name, then folder, then username
- **Interactive selection** - choose which fields to sort by
- **Efficient algorithm** - uses binary search for optimal performance
- **Debug output** - see exactly how entries are being compared

#### `convert_app_links.py` - URI Format Converter

Converts Android app links in already-processed Bitwarden CSV files to the correct `androidapp://` format for proper autofill functionality.

**Use case:** If you previously converted passwords before this format fix was discovered, run this tool to update your existing Bitwarden CSV files without redoing the entire interactive conversion process.

### 📄 Expected CSV Files

- **`Passwords.csv`** - Your input file (from browser export)
  - Expected fields: `url`, `username`, `password`
- **`Bitwarden_Pswds.csv`** - Generated output for Bitwarden import
- **`Sorted_Pswds.csv`** - Final organized password list
  - This is useful to better see similar fields of your choice, and make any small edits

## Typical Workflow

1. **Export** passwords from your browser and save as `Passwords.csv`
2. **Convert** with interactive name selection:
   ```
   python csv_to_bitwarden.py
   ```
3. **Sort** your organized passwords:
   ```
   python sort.py
   ```
4. **Import** `Sorted_Pswds.csv` into Bitwarden

### Express Mode

For bulk processing with minimal interaction:

- Choose "Express Mode" when prompted
- Skip optional fields (favorites, notes, TOTP)
- Faster processing with basic organization

## 🌟 Smart Features

### Intelligent Name Detection

- **Website URLs:** `https://docs.google.com/` → suggests "Docs", "Google"
- **Android Apps:** `androidapp://com.instagram.android` → suggests "Instagram", "Android"
- **Streamlined selection:** Auto-generated options accept instantly, custom names get confirmation
- **Custom names:** Always option to enter your own

### Folder Management

- **Pre-loaded categories:** Personal, Work, Social Media, Banking, etc.
- **Fuzzy matching:** Types "Bankng" → suggests "Banking"
- **Create on-the-fly:** New folders created during conversion process

### Android App Support

- **Automatic recognition** of `androidapp://` protocol URLs for proper Bitwarden autofill
- **Package name mapping** using the companion dictionary
- **Clean, readable names** instead of cryptic package identifiers
- **Format conversion** from browser export `android://` to Bitwarden `androidapp://` format

## 🔧 System Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** (uses only standard library)
- **Any operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Compatible browser** (Chrome, Edge, or Chromium-based browsers)

## 🤝 Help Build the Database

**Want to make this tool better?**

I'm building a **community-driven database** of app and website mappings. If you encounter apps or websites that show cryptic names like:

- `com.mysterious.app.package` instead of "MyFavoriteApp"
- `weird-subdomain.confusing-domain.com` instead of "CleanSiteName"

**Please contribute!** Here's how:

### Fork & Add Mappings

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Edit `uri_mapping.py`** - add your mappings to:
   - `ANDROID_MAPPING` for Android apps
   - `HREF_MAPPING` for websites
3. **Submit a pull request**

**Example contributions:**

```python
# Android Apps
"com.newapp.android": ["NewApp"],
"tv.streaming.service": ["StreamingTV"],

# Websites  
"secure-login.bankname.com": ["BankName"],
"shop.retailer.co.uk": ["Retailer", "Shopping"],
```

### Guidelines for Mappings

- **Keep it minimal**: Use base domains like `facebook.com` (not `m.facebook.com` or `mobile.facebook.com`)
- **Preserve distinct services**: Keep specific subdomains like `docs.google.com` when they're separate services
- **Use clean names**: `["Facebook"]` not `["Facebook Inc."]` or `["FB"]`

### What I'm Looking For

- **Popular apps** missing from the database
- **Banking/financial sites** with complex subdomains
- **Regional websites** from different countries
- **Work/enterprise tools** with cryptic domain names

Every contribution helps users get cleaner, more organized password imports.

## 📝 Supported Export Formats

This tool works with password exports from:

- ✅ **Google Chrome**
- ✅ **Microsoft Edge**
- ✅ **Chromium-based browsers** (Brave, Vivaldi, Opera - usually work)
- ❓ **Other browsers** - Check if your export has `url,username,password` headers

**Note:** Firefox and Safari use different export formats and may need manual header adjustment.

---

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

- **"Must be a Microsoft or Google csv file"** → Check your CSV has `url,username,password` headers (Firefox/Safari exports may need manual header editing)
- **Python not recognized** → Make sure Python was added to PATH during installation
- **Empty usernames** → Tool will prompt you to enter missing information

**Pro Tips:**

- Use **Express Mode** for large password lists (500+ entries)
- **List folders** anytime during conversion to see available options
- **Skip entries** that are problematic - you can always re-run later
